## Introduction

In this project, you will create a cute chameleon character that senses colour then changes to that colour. You will also sense humdity then display the reading in a graphic.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">chameleon</span> is a type of lizard that has developed the ability to adapt its skin colour to its surroundings. They  have a long, curling tale to enable them to sit securely on tree branches. Humidity is important to chameleons. A chameleon needs the humidity of it's environment to be over 50% to remain healthy.

You will:
+ Use the **colour** and **humidity sensors** on the SenseHAT
+ Use a **while loop** to continuously detect for sensor data changes
+ Use **if statements** to display images based on sensor data
